## What is it?
OpenKIWI sits in the same automation space as other tools like Openclaw, but differentiates itself with a security-first design and a streamlined onboarding experience that gets you started in minutes.

How is OpenKIWI different?

#### Security by default
* Everything runs in isolated Docker containers
* Agents can only access what you explicitly grant

#### Multi-model, agent-first
* Switch between providers or run local models without rebuilding your workflow logic.

#### No session hijacking or OAuth shenanigans
* OpenKIWI plays by the rules and aims to be enterprise-ready, with a clear and auditable security posture.

#### Onboarding in minutes, not hours.
* Clone the repo, run one command and you're up in about 30 seconds. A few quick settings in the UI and you're running your first agent. The whole process takes about 3 minutes.
* No 20-minute YouTube tutorial required.
